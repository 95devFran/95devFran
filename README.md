### 🌍 About Me

I currently work in web development focused on the geospatial environment. I design interactive map viewers using:

- 🧭 **Leaflet**
- 🖼️ **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- ⚛️ **React** (in the process of learning and applying)
- 🛠️ **Visual Studio Code** as my main environment

I also have experience using **Python** to automate tasks within GIS projects, especially integrated with **QGIS**, optimizing workflows and spatial analysis processes.
